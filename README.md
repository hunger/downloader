`downloader` is a crate to help with easily downloading of files from the
internet. It takes a simple simple and straightforward approach using a url
builder and fetcher.

It supports system proxy configuration, parallel downloads of different files,
validation of downloads via a callback, as well as files mirroring across different
machines.

Callbacks to provide progress information are supported as well.

## Usage

### Installation via Cargo

Add the following line into your `Cargo.toml` file to make `downloader` a
`[dependency]` of your crate:

`downloader = "<VERSION>"`

Alternatively you can run `cargo add downloader`. See crates.io for the latest
version of the package.

### Example

```rust
use downloader::downloader::Builder;
use downloader::Download;
use std::path::Path;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let image = Download::new("https://example.com/example.png");
    // other downloads...
    // image.urls.push("https://example.com/example2.png");

    let mut dl = Builder::default()
        .connect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(4))
        .download_folder(Path::new("../res")) // or any arbitrary path
        .parallel_requests(8)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    let response = dl.download(&[image]).unwrap(); // other error handling

    response.iter().for_each(|v| match v {
        Ok(v) => println!("Downloaded: {:?}", v),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
    })
}
```

### Features

- `tui` feature uses `indicatif` crate to provide a text ui for downloads
- `verify` feature enables (optional) verification of downloads using sha3 hashes
